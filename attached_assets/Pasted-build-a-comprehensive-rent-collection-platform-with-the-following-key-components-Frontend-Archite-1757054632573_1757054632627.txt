build the frontend component

I'll build a comprehensive frontend for your rent collection and management platform. Let me start by creating the main application structure with authentication, dashboard, and all the key components.

I've built a comprehensive rent collection and management platform for State House Block D. The application includes all the core features you specified:


Key Features Implemented:


• Authentication System - Login/signup with role-based access (Landlord, Caretaker, Tenant)
• Interactive Room Matrix - Visual grid of all 74 units with color-coded status (Green=Paid, Yellow=Pending, Red=Overdue, Gray=Vacant)
• Tenant Management - Complete CRUD operations for tenant data with search and filtering
• Payment Processing - M-Pesa integration interface, payment history, and multiple payment methods
• Analytics & Reports - Revenue tracking, occupancy rates, payment status charts with export functionality
• System Settings - Configurable notification preferences, security settings, and system-wide configurations


Dashboard Features:

    Real-time occupancy metrics (89% occupancy rate displayed)
    Monthly revenue tracking (KSh 890K shown)
    Color-coded room status matrix with search functionality
    Role-based navigation and access control
    SMS notification system for payment reminders
    Comprehensive reporting with multiple chart types


The application uses a clean, professional design with Tailwind CSS and includes mock data for demonstration. The frontend is fully responsive and ready for backend integration when your Supabase connection is resolved.


• Next Steps: Integrate M-Pesa Daraja API for live payments, connect SMS service for automated reminders, and set up the backend database schema
• Testing: You can test different user roles using the demo credentials shown in the login form
• Mobile Ready: The interface is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile management
